# Pool worker: standing rules

These rules hold for the whole run of every pool worker. The spawn carries only parameters: row, session, role and, for traversal, surface.

## 1. Heartbeat first

Write `.gm/pool/<session>.live` in the project root with exactly three lines:

    session: <session>
    row: <row id>
    start: <ISO-8601 UTC>

Before writing, read every `.gm/pool/*.live`. If a fresh one (under 10 minutes old) names your row, stop and return `row held by <session>`.

Refresh the heartbeat at least every 5 minutes, at any gm call, not only while you wait on a lock or a long run.

## 2. Check the row

Read the last block for your row id in the gm store. The last block decides the state. If the row is absent or resolved, delete your heartbeat and return.

## 3. Role

- Row resolver: run the nine stages on the row's own criteria.
- Traversal hop: log node-only PRDs and resolve none.
  - Each confirmed node-only row is prd-added at once, the moment it is confirmed. Never batch rows to the end of the hop.
  - A hop with zero rows logged 15 minutes after its heartbeat start stops and returns a receipt: surfaces scanned, candidates checked, rows logged (0), and the reason.

## 4. Execution limits

- Node only, unless the row names a GPU or browser arm and the lock or lease is free.
- Never use Monitor, ScheduleWakeup, CronCreate, shell sleep, or shell grep.
- Wait only with gm verbs: the `wait` verb with body `{"ms": N}`, where N is a positive integer in milliseconds, maximum 60000 per call. Example: `dispatch wait --body '{"ms":3000}'`.

## 5. Git

Each worker commits and pushes its own scoped change in the same run. Do not wait for the orchestrator to ask.

- Commit with `git_commit` and explicit `paths` naming only the files this run changed, then push with `git_push {"rev":"HEAD"}`. `git_finalize` with the same `paths` does both in one call. Never commit without `paths`.
- Leave other lanes' modified or untracked files uncommitted. Read `git_status` first, and commit only the paths you changed.
- Commit as lanmower, the configured git identity, with no trailers: no Co-Authored-By, Claude-Session or generated-by line. The message states the change and why it was made.
- Stay on main. A worker creates no branch or worktree and never amends a pushed commit.
- Read the pushed commit back with `git_show {"rev":"<sha>"}`, check its CI with `ci-status {"sha":"<sha>","github_repo":"<owner/name>"}`, and report the sha and CI state in your return. A pending or unknown CI state is reported as such, never as passing.
- Raw git in Bash stays forbidden; every git operation goes through a gm git verb.

## 6. Blockers

Record each blocker as a new row with id `<row>-blocker-<session>`. Never reuse the row's own id, because that rescopes the row.

## 7. Closing

1. Nominate a successor from the `slots.candidates` list in the orchestrator's instruction response. A free-text nomination is advisory only.
2. Delete your heartbeat.
3. Return: the stage reached; the receipt or blocker (the RESULT line or the failing output); files changed; the successor.
